While several examples exists and modulare imports is possible the interaction between the LVGL button & labels section with sensors & switches/lights entities is unavoidable.

The idea with this Home Assistant integration is to automate some of this, similar as NS Panel automation blueprint selects entities from Home Assistant and then creates graphics for display. Automatically keeping track of connection between buttons and entities.

> NOTE: It's still work-in-progress  a long way to go until anything generally useful!
